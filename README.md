# Project Title: [Your Thesis Title Here]

## System Repository Template

This repository is the **system repository** in the institutional two-repository model.

Use it for:

* MVP source code and configuration
* tests and validation evidence
* CI/CD workflows and release records
* architecture, implementation, and deployment evidence that supports the manuscript

Do **not** use this repository as the main location of the research manuscript. The chapter-based manuscript, appendices, and formal gate records belong in the separate documentation repository.

## Institutional Alignment

This template is designed to support the manual's engineering workflow:

* **DSR** frames the project around requirements, implementation, and validation
* **Scrum** manages sprint planning, execution, review, and retrospective work
* **GitFlow** keeps implementation work traceable through issues, branches, pull requests, releases, and tags

The minimum expectation for this repository is that a reviewer can verify what was built, how it was validated, and which release corresponds to the evidence cited in the manuscript.

## Expected Branch Model

Use the following branches unless your instructor or organization specifies a stricter variant:

* `main` for approved and release-ready milestones
* `develop` for accepted sprint work awaiting release
* `feat/<issue-number>-<short-description>-<username>` for implementation work
* `release/<name>` for milestone or defense-ready release preparation
* `hotfix/<short-description>` for urgent fixes on released work

## Suggested Workflow

1. Create or refine a GitHub Issue for the story, defect, or engineering task.
2. Create a `feat/*` branch from `develop`.
3. Implement the change together with tests and supporting evidence updates.
4. Open a pull request to `develop` with links to the related issue and verification evidence.
5. Prepare a `release/*` branch when a sprint or defense milestone is ready.
6. Merge approved release work to `main` and create a release tag.

## Repository Structure

```text

└── pull_request_template.md

src/
├── README.md
tests/
└── README.md
```

## What Goes Where

* `src/` contains the actual MVP implementation.
* `tests/` contains automated tests, manual test scripts, fixtures, and related evidence.
* `.github/` contains issue and pull request scaffolds, and can later include CI workflows under `.github/workflows/`.

## Definition of Done

A story or task should not be treated as complete unless it satisfies all applicable checks below:

* implementation is merged through a reviewed pull request
* relevant tests or validation steps were executed
* related technical evidence in the system repository or paired documentation repository was updated when the change affects architecture, validation, deployment, or release traceability
* the issue, pull request, and branch naming remain traceable to the work performed

## Recommended Next Setup Steps

1. Protect `main` and `develop`.
2. Add a `CODEOWNERS` file that matches the actual team and reviewers.
3. Add CI workflows under `.github/workflows/`.
4. Replace the scaffold files in `src/` and `tests/`, and add any project-specific evidence folders your stack requires as implementation progresses.
